# AlignmentAutomation
This project documents the automation process of vacuum alignment of a global-discrete charged BSM theory. 

The process currently includes A4 and Î”(27) symmetries. Each section of the code attempts to reproduce the results obtained analytically in each corresponding papers that introduces the inclusion of family-charged familon scalar fields called flavons. 

The current progress includes the automation of 10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.05.005, 10.1007/JHEP09(2018)047, 10.1007/JHEP03(2018)007. The project is associated with the DECO algorithm that calculates the number of contractions of an effective Wilsonian term of dimension n using the Hilbert Series. 
The latest update includes 243 contractions of a 6 dimensional term constructed from three triplet-product invariants.
